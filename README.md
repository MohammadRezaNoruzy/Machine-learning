# Gaussian Basis Functions & Gradient Descent in Python

This repository contains code for implementing Gaussian basis functions and comparing the direct method with gradient descent for regression tasks.

## Code Overview

The code includes the following main components:
- **Sine Function**: A target function to generate synthetic data.
- **Data Generation**: Creating noisy sine wave data and splitting it into training and testing sets.
- **Gaussian Basis Function**: Implementation of Gaussian basis functions.
- **Direct Method**: Calculating weights using the direct method for regression.
- **Gradient Descent**: Implementing gradient descent to optimize weights.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Functions to compute MSE for evaluating model performance.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the results to compare the predictions from direct method and gradient descent.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
